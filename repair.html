  <h3>About Right to Repair</h3>
  <p>The Right to Repair movement advocates for the ability of consumers to repair and modify their own electronic devices, including computers, without facing unnecessary barriers from manufacturers. It aims to promote transparency, accessibility to repair manuals and tools, and the availability of spare parts.</p>
  <p>To repair your own computer, here are some general tips:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Identify the Problem:</strong> Diagnose the issue with your computer, whether it's a hardware or software problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Research:</strong> Look for online resources, forums, and guides specific to your computer model and the problem you're facing.</li>
    <li><strong>Gather Tools:</strong> Ensure you have the necessary tools such as screwdrivers, pliers, and anti-static equipment.</li>
    <li><strong>Be Cautious:</strong> Follow safety precautions and handle components carefully to avoid damage.</li>
    <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Begin with simpler repairs like replacing a RAM module or cleaning dust from the fans before attempting more complex tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Consult Professionals:</strong> If you're unsure or uncomfortable with a repair, don't hesitate to seek assistance from professional technicians or online communities.</li>
  </ul>
