    <h1>Build Your Own Computer</h1>
    <p>Customize and build your perfect computer.</p>
    
    <section class="description">
      <h2>Budget</h2>
      <p>Understanding your budget for your computer build is a crucial part of saving money. It is important to understand that it is up to you to stay within your budget and plan accordingly.</p>
      
      <h2>Tools</h2>
      <p>Some of the basic tools required to build a computer are a screwdriver and a desk to work on.</p>
      
      <h2>Parts List</h2>
      <h3>CPU</h3>
      <p>One of the most crucial parts of building a computer is the CPU or Central Processing Unit. The CPU is in charge of operating tasks and making sure they run smoothly. When searching for a CPU from these two brands, it is important to select either the AMD 5000 series and above or the Intel 12th generation and above, as going further back in CPUs isnâ€™t going to increase performance.</p>
      
      <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>
      <p>For the CPU to maintain safe temperatures, it must be cooled. There are three types of coolers: AIO (All-in-one), Air, and Water. Air coolers are by far the most simple and cheap while water coolers are the most expensive and overkill. For some more powerful CPUs, the AIO, which is both an air cooler and water cooler, is recommended.</p>
      
      <h3>Motherboard</h3>
      <p>The housing unit of most of your computer parts. It is important to select the motherboard that is compatible with your CPU and the generation it is from.</p>
      
      <h3>RAM</h3>
      <p>The RAM is essential as it allows you to be on multiple tasks at the same time without the other crashing. In simpler terms, more is better, but for most, 16 gigabytes is a safe spot. Also, remember to pick the RAM that is compatible with your motherboard (Either DDR4 or DDR5) and decent speed (3200 MHz and above for DDR4 or above 6000 MHz for DDR5).</p>
      
      <h3>Storage</h3>
      <p>In 2024, it is unwise to boot off hard drives, so it is important to pick up an SSD, specifically an M.2. They are faster and much more modern. Make sure to get enough storage for your needs, and also get Gen 3 or above.</p>
      
      <h3>GPU</h3>
      <p>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is going to be one of the costlier components. Like the CPU, its performance equates to the amount you spend on the product. Choose carefully between Nvidia (more all-out performance/expensive) and AMD (better bang for your buck).</p>
      
      <h3>Case</h3>
      <p>This is where you get to personalize your build more and make it unique. Pick a color and size that fits your motherboard.</p>
      
      <h3>PSU</h3>
      <p>The PSU (Power Supply Unit) is what powers your build. Checking your CPU and GPU and making sure you get the appropriate wattage PSU is important for your PC to run. Make sure the PSU is rated 80+ Bronze and above.</p>
      
      <h3>Remaining parts</h3>
      <p>Some include lighting or fans required to cool your PC down even more.</p>
      
      <h2>Building the Computer</h2>
      <h3>Prepare Case</h3>
      <p>Open the case and install the power supply. Ensure proper cable management.</p>
      
      <h3>Install CPU</h3>
      <p>Insert the CPU into the motherboard socket, aligning it correctly. Apply thermal paste if not pre-applied.</p>
      
      <h3>Attach Cooler</h3>
      <p>Secure the CPU cooler onto the CPU, ensuring it is tightly fastened.</p>
      
      <h3>Insert RAM</h3>
      <p>Slot the RAM sticks into the designated slots on the motherboard, ensuring they click into place.</p>
      
      <h3>Mount Motherboard</h3>
      <p>Place the motherboard into the case, aligning it with the standoffs. Secure it with screws.</p>
      
      <h3>Install Storage</h3>
      <p>Insert the SSD (preferably an M.2) into the appropriate slot on the motherboard. Secure it with a screw.</p>
      
      <h3>Add GPU</h3>
      <p>Insert the graphics card into the PCIe slot on the motherboard. Secure it with screws.</p>
      
      <h3>Connect Cables</h3>
      <p>Connect the power supply cables to the motherboard, GPU, and storage devices. Attach front panel connectors for USB, audio, and power buttons.</p>
      
      <h3>Power On</h3>
      <p>Plug in the power supply, connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and power on the system.</p>
      
      <h3>Install OS</h3>
      <p>Insert the OS installation media (USB drive), boot from it, and follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system.</p>
